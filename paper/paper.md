# Summary

Regression has been widely applied in statistical modeling in social science, biology etc. While regression 
can often help making predictions or forecasting, it is also widely used to determine causal relationships between 
different variables, especially in treatment-control settings. "Pysensemakr" is build upon the python package "statsmodels", 
which performs regression analysis. "Pysensemakr" reports some key causal quantities based on the routine regression output and
provides visualization and  causal interpretation of these quantities.
